title: "Computing access"

To access computing resources for the introductory data science courses offered by the Duke University Department of Statistical Science, go to the [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) website, [cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers).

If this is your first time accessing the containers, click on `reserve STA198-199` on the *Reservations available* menu on the right. You only need to do this once, and when you do, you\'ll see this container moved to the *My reservations* menu on the left.

Next, click on `STA101` under *My reservations* to access the RStudio instance you\'ll use for the course.

Note: Before fall break we used [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/spaces/405361). You can still access your previous work there.
