# Warm up

## Before we get started

::: task
{{< fa user >}} Check your email and accept the invitations to the course GitHub organization!
:::

## Reflection

::: question
{{< fa users >}} What is one thing you learned from your reading that was "new" to you? And what is one question you have from the reading?

## Announcements

-   HW 1 is posted, due next Tuesday at 1 pm

# Meet the toolkit: Version control and collaboration with Git and GitHub

## Git and GitHub {.smaller}

Git is a version control system, like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful.

GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet, like DropBox but much better.

## Connecting your Posit Cloud and GitHub accounts

You should only need to do the following once:

-   Go to [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/spaces/406325/) and log in.

-   Click on your profile avatar (top right) and then click on "Authentication".

-   Under Login Options, check the box for "Enabled". This will open another window where you should click on "Authorize rstudio".

-   Then, go back to the Posit Cloud authentication page, and check the box for "Private repo access also enabled".

## Application exercise: Flint {.smaller}

::: task
{{< fa user >}} 

-   Go to the course GitHub Organization and locate your own `ae-03-flint` repository. This repository will be called `ae-03-flint-YOUR_GITHUB_NAME`.

-   Click on the green **Code** button, make sure HTTPS is selected, and copy the URL (by clicking on {{< fa copy size=l >}}).

-   Go to Posit Cloud. Make sure you're in the course space -- it should say STA 113 - F23 on the top left.

-   Click on the blue **New Project** button, and then **New Project from Git Repository**. Paste the URL you copied from your GitHub repository here. Make sure *Add packages from the base project* is checked.

*continue on next slide*

## Application exercise: Flint {.smaller}

::: task
-   Once you're in the project, go to the Console and run

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    usethis::create_github_token()
    ```

-   On the page that pops open in your browser, create a new GitHub Personal Access Token (i.e., sort of like a password you store):

    -   Describe the token's use case under *Note*, e.g., `ae-03`

    -   Extend expiration date to 90 days

    -   Scroll down and click on **Generate Token**

-   Copy the token by clicking on {{< fa copy >}}.

-   Go back to Posit Cloud, to your Console, and run

    ```{r}
    #| eval: false

    gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
    ```

    and paste the token you just copied.

üéâ You're now ready to work on your application exercise analyzing a dataset with **R**, in **RStudio** that you access via **Posit Cloud**, version controlled with **Git**, and hosted on **GitHub**. And that's your data science toolkit! üõ†Ô∏è

# Wrap up

## Next time

-   We'll continue to learn about visualizing various types of data and get practice with the data science workflow.

-   We'll review questions you might have on the homework assignment.
