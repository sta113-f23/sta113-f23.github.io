    "markdown": "---\ntitle: \"Project 2\"\n---\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nYour task for this project is to create *something* that uses data visualization.\n\nThis is intentionally vague -- part of the challenge is to design a project that showcases best your interests and strengths.\n\nYou're relatively unconstrained on what your project might look like, but there are two requirements:\n\n1.  The focus of your project should be related to one or more ideas from your other FOCUS courses.\n2.  Your project should feature some element that you had to learn on your own. This could be a package you use that we didn't teach in class (e.g., a package for building 3D visualizations) or a workflow (e.g., making illustrated data visualizations) or anything else. If you're not sure if your \"new\" thing counts, just ask!\n\n## Ideas\n\nHere are a few ideas to help you get started thinking:\n\n-   Ask a research question that is related to a concept you were introduced to in one of your other FOCUS courses and answer it with data visualization.\n-   Use data visualization to create educate/inform others about an important issue raised in one of your other FOCUS courses.\n-   Make a data visualization telling a story highlighted in one of your other FOCUS courses and convert it to an illustration, presenting both the computational and artistic piece side by side.\n-   Build a dashboard reporting on an issue covered in one of your other FOCUS courses.\n\nEven better, the focus of your project can touch on multiple FOCUS courses, since each team has members from all three other courses in the KISS cluster.\n\nBe prepared to brainstorm a bunch of ideas and discard them until you settle on a topic that everyone in the team is happy with and feels like a good choice for showcasing what you've learned in the class and how you can use that to learn something new and implement for your project.\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe dataset you use cannot be the same dataset from Project 1 or any other dataset we used in class. And, importantly, it should be something truly of interest to your team, and a dataset that allows for a deep exploration.\n\n## Workflow\n\n-   Week 1 of project (week of October 24): Pick a focus for your project.\n\n-   Week 2 of project (week of October 31): Work on developing your project proposal and setting up the structure for your repository.\n\n-   Week 3 of project (week of November 7): Finalize your project proposal + Conduct peer review on project proposals, and optionally, submit in an updated version of your proposal.\n\n-   Week 4 of project (week of November 14): Continue working on your project.\n\n-   Week 5 of project (week of November 21): Continue working on your project, incorporating feedback from proposals.\n\n-   Week 6 of project (week of November 28): Continue working on your project.\n\n-   Week 7 of project (week of December 5): Conduct peer code review + Present projects and turn in final write-up.\n\n## Due dates\n\nDue dates related to Project 2 are on the course schedule page.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### Proposal\n\nYour proposal should include:\n\n-   A one sentence description of your high-level goal (such as the ones listed under [Ideas] above.\n\n-   A one to two paragraph description of your goals, including your motivation. Depending on the focus of your project, the following might go in here.\n\n    -   If using particular dataset(s), a brief description of each dataset including the reason why you chose the particular dataset, its dataset, its dimensions and any other relevant metadata. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\n\n    -   If answering a particular research question, the question itself and the reason why you chose this question.\n\n-   A weekly \"plan of attack\" outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.\n\n-   The final organization of your project repository. This means describing the project organization in your proposal as well as implementing that organization in your repo. Create any folders needed and place a `README.md` in each folder explaining what goes in there.\n\n### Peer review\n\nThe peer reviews will be completed during the first 20 minutes of the class sessions they're listed in. On those days teams will have access to the project repos of the teams whose work they're reviewing. The first peer review will be of proposals and the second peer review will be of code and organization.\n\n#### Reviewer tasks\n\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the *Issues* tab, click on the green *New issue* button on the top right, and then click on the green *Get started* button for the issue template titled *Proposal peer review* or *Code peer review*.\n\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You're expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn't necessarily require lengthy responses.\n\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project you're reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their work. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that's an additional incentive to do a good job.\n\n#### Reviewee tasks\n\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits. Regardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like *\"Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1\"*.\n\n#### Peer review assignments\n\nThe peer review assignments will be posted soon!\n\n### Write-up\n\nYour have a lot more freedom in how you structure your write-up for this project compared to Project 1. This also comes with responsibility. You should make sure you have a clear introduction and a clear conclusion. You should also have other interim section headings that help the reader. Your write-up should be somewhere between 1000 and 2000 words. There is no expectation that you get close to the upper limit, anywhere in that range is fine as long as you have clearly explained yourself. The limits are provided to help you, not to set stressful expectations.\n\n### Presentation\n\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 8 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time.\n\nYou should create your presentation in a reproducible way, e.g., using Quarto. If you prefer to build a dashboard, that's fine too. The only rule is that it's built reproducibly using Quarto and R.\n\nYour evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don't care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n### Website\n\nEach of your projects will have a website. You can use the same workflow as for your first project or create something different. For example, if your project is building a dashboard, you might consider making your write-up a tab on that dashboard. Feel free to google your way around it or ask in class, on Slack, or office hours!\n\n## Repo organization\n\nSince you have complete freedom on the focus of your project, you also have complete freedom on the organization of your repository. But... it should be organized in a logical way!\n\nAt a minimum each project should have an `index.qmd`. If your project is analyzing a dataset, you'll probably want to structure your repo similar to your Project 1 repo.\n\n## Grading\n\n| Total                                                                            | 100 pts |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Proposal \\| 10 pts \\|                                                            |         |\n| Presentation \\| 30 pts \\| \\| \\| (25 pts from teaching team, 5 pts from audience) |         |\n| Write-up \\| 30 pts \\|                                                            |         |\n| Reproducibility, style, and organization[^1]                                     | 10 pts  |\n| Within team peer evaluation[^2]                                                  | 10 pts  |\n| Between team peer evaluation[^3]                                                 | 10 pts  |\n\n[^1]: Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted.\n\n[^2]: This relates to your contribution to the teamwork and how your team members evaluate this contribution. Scores for each teammate will be different for this component of the project grade.\n\n[^3]: This relates to the quality and quantity of the peer review you provide for other teams.\n\nSome of the components are further detailed below.\n\nNote that there will be points allocated to commits from each team member for the proposal, presentation, and write-up.\n\n### Proposal (10 points)\n\n-   High level goal\n-   Expanded description\n-   Plan\n-   Repo organization\n-   Workflow - Peer review issues closed via commits\n-   Teamwork - All team members must contribute to the repo via commits\n\n### Presentation (30 points)\n\n#### Teaching team (25 points)\n\n-   Time management: Did the team divide the time well among themselves or got cut off going over time?

(2 points)\n\n## Guidelines\n\nPlease use the project repository that has been created for your team to complete your project. Everything should be done reproducibly. This means that I should be able to clone your repo and reproduce everything you've submitted as part of your project.\n\nAll results presented must have corresponding code. If you do calculations by hand instead of using R and then report the results from the calculations, you will not receive credit for those calculations. Any answers/results given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be considered. For example, if you're reporting the number of observations in your dataset, don't just write the number manually, use inline R code to calculate the number. All code reported in your final project document should work properly. Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. Code which produces certain warnings and messages is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean. In such cases you can add `warning: false` and `message: false` in the relevant R chunks. Warnings that signal lifecycle changes (e.g., a function is deprecated and there's a newer/better function out there) should generally be addressed by updating your code, not just by hiding the warning.\n\n## Tips\n\n-   We hope some of you will take the challenge to be adventurous and learn some new skills as part of this project. We're happy to support you along the way, so don't hesitate to ask as many questions as needed!\n\n-   You're working in the same repo as your teammates now, so merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that's fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\n\n-   Review the marking guidelines below and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.\n\n-   Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\n\n-   Set aside time to work together and apart (physically).\n\n-   Code:\n\n    -   In your presentation your code should be hidden (`echo: false`) so that your slides are neat and easy to read. However your document should include all your code such that if I re-render your Quarto file I should be able to obtain the results you presented. **Exception:** If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you're welcomed to show that portion.\n\n    -   In your write-up your code should be visible.\n\n-   Teamwork: You are to complete the assignment as a team. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficiently contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different team members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment work.\n\n-   When you're done, review the documents on GitHub to make sure you're happy with the final state of your work. Then go get some rest!\n",
