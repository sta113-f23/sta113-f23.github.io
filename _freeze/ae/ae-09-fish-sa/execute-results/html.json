The dataset we will use, called `fish`, is on two common fish species in fish market sales. We're going to investigate the relationship between the weights and heights of fish, and later take into consider species as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nfish <- read_csv(\"data/fish.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data dictionary is below:\n\n| **variable**      | **description**        |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| `species`         | Species name of fish   |\n| `weight`          | Weight, in grams       |\n| `length_vertical` | Vertical length, in cm |\n| `length_diagonal` | Diagonal length, in cm |\n| `length_cross`    | Cross length, in cm    |\n| `height`          | Height, in cm          |\n| `width`           | Diagonal width, in cm  |\n\n# Visualizing the relationship\n\nWe're going to investigate the relationship between the weights and heights of fish.\n\n-   **Demo:** Create an appropriate plot to investigate this relationship.
