The data analysis exercises R the same, but workflow steps have been updated for a Git and GitHub based workflow.\n:::\n\n# Goals\n\nBy the end of this application exercise you will\n\n-   meet the **full** computational toolkit for the course\n-   practice using `glimpse()`, `names()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `count()`\n-   define and compute various statistics\n-   begin to gain familiarity with making data visualizations with `ggplot()`\n\nWe will do this using water lead content data from Flint, MI. The following paragraph will be useful in evaluating the lead amount values we'll see in the dataset.\n\n> While there is no completely safe amount of lead consumption, the limit allowed by the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) of 1991 is 15 parts per billion (ppb). If this is exceeded in more than 10% of homes tested (or if the 90th percentile value of the total sample is above 15 ppb), action is required. And to make sure problems are caught, sampling for lead in water is supposed to target the \"worst-case\" homes -- those in areas served by lead pipes.\n\n# Back to analysis\n\n## Load packages\n\nWe'll use the tidyverse package for analysis, which offers functionality for data import, wrangling, visualization, and more.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLoading this package prints out a message. What does this message mean? How can we suppress the message from the output?\n\n## Load data\n\nThe `read_csv()` function can be used for reading CSV (comma separated values) files. The file we're reading is called `flint` with the suffix (`.csv`) which indicates its file type. The file is in the `data` folder.\n\nBefore reading in the file, go to the `data` folder in the Files pane to confirm that it is, indeed, there. Then, read the file by running the code chunk below by clicking on the green triangle icon on the code chunk.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflint <- read_csv(\"data/flint.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 813 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): draw\ndbl (4): id, zip, ward, lead\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne of two things may have happened:\n\n1.  The file was read successfully and you now see a dataset called `flint` in your Environment pane.\n2.  The file was not read successfully and you see an error `Error in read_csv(\"data/flint.csv\") : could not find function \"read_csv\"`.\n\nIf (1) happened, great!\n\nIf (2) happened, let's troubleshoot first before continuing.\n\n## Data dictionary\n\nThe following variables are in the `flint` data frame:\n\n-   `id`: sample ID number (identifies the home)\n-   `zip`: ZIP code in Flint of the sample's location\n-   `ward`: ward in Flint of the sample's location\n-   `draw`: which time point the water was sampled from\n-   `lead`: lead content in parts per billion (ppb)\n\n## Populations and samples\n\nWe want to learn about the **population** using a **sample**.\n\nIn the case we want to learn about the lead content in all of Flint, MI homes but only have available water readings from a sample of homes (our data set).\n\n**Exercise 1:** Look at the data, how many observations are there? How many variables?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push, with an appropriate commit message like \"Finished Exercise 1\". Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n## Frequencies\n\nLet's `count()` to find the number of different time points water was sampled with the `count()` function.\n\n-   The first argument is `flint`: the data frame\n\n-   The second argument is `draw`: the variable\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncount(flint, draw)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  draw       n\n  <chr>  <int>\n1 first    271\n2 second   271\n3 third    271\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can achieve the same result with the following \"piped\" operation as well.\n\n-   The first line is `flint`: the data frame\n\n-   Then the pipe operator, read as \"and then\", which places what comes before it as the first argument of what comes after it\n\n-   The second line is `count(draw)`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflint |>\n  count(draw)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  draw       n\n  <chr>  <int>\n1 first    271\n2 second   271\n3 third    271\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can use a similar approach to fund out how many unique homes are in the data set:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nflint |>\n  count(id)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 269 × 2\n      id     n\n   <dbl> <int>\n 1     1     3\n 2     2     3\n 3     4     3\n 4     5     3\n 5     6     3\n 6     7     3\n 7     8     3\n 8     9     3\n 9    12     3\n10    13     3\n# ℹ 259 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Exercise 2:** How many samples were taken from each zip code?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Exercise 3:** Which ZIP code had the most samples drawn?

Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n# Summarization\n\nWhat is a statistic? It's **any mathematical function of the data**. Sometimes, a statistic is referred to as \"sample statistic\" or \"summary statistic\", since you compute it from a **sample** (the observed data) and not the entire **population**.\n\n## Measures of central tendency\n\n-   mean\n-   median\n-   mode\n\n## Measures of spread\n\n-   variance\n-   standard deviation\n-   range\n-   quartiles\n-   inter-quartile range (IQR)\n\n## Order statistics\n\n-   quantiles\n-   minimum (0 percentile)\n-   median (50th percentile)\n-   maximum (100 percentile)\n\n... and any other arbitrary function of the data you can come up with!\n\n**Exercise 4:** Compute each of these statistics for `lead` ppb.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push, with an appropriate commit message.

Add `x` and `y` labels; add a title by inserting `title = \"title_name\"` inside the `labs()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = flint_focus, aes(y = factor(zip), x = lead)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(draw))) +\n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\", fill = \"Flushing time\") +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\n    breaks = c(\"first\", \"second\", \"third\"),\n    labels = c(\"0 (sec)\", \"45 (sec)\", \"120 (sec)\")\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-03-flint_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push, with an appropriate commit message. Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n:::\n\n**Exercise 8:** Add labels for `x`, `y`, a `title`, and `subtitle` to the code below to update the corresponding plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = flint_focus, aes(y = factor(zip), x = lead)) +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(draw))) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"___\", y = \"___\", fill = \"Flushing time\",\n    title = \"___\",\n    subtitle = \"___\"\n    ) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(\n    breaks = c(\"first\", \"second\", \"third\"),\n    labels = c(\"0 (sec)\", \"45 (sec)\", \"120 (sec)\")\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 50)) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-03-flint_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Exercise 9:** What is the difference between the two plots?
