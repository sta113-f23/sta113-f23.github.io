The dataset we will use, called `fish`, is on two common fish species in fish market sales. We're going to investigate the relationship between the weights and heights of fish, and later take into consider species as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nfish <- read_csv(\"data/fish.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe data dictionary is below:\n\n| **variable**      | **description**        |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| `species`         | Species name of fish   |\n| `weight`          | Weight, in grams       |\n| `length_vertical` | Vertical length, in cm |\n| `length_diagonal` | Diagonal length, in cm |\n| `length_cross`    | Cross length, in cm    |\n| `height`          | Height, in cm          |\n| `width`           | Diagonal width, in cm  |\n\n# Interpreting multiple regression models\n\nIn the previous application exercise you saw that the model predicting weight from height and species was a better fit. In this section we will interpret the coefficients of this model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfish_whs_fit <- linear_reg() |>\n  fit(weight ~ height + species, data = fish)\n\ntidy(fish_whs_fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 3 Ã— 5\n  term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)    -828.      69.7     -11.9  1.92e-16\n2 height           95.2      4.54     21.0  5.10e-27\n3 speciesRoach    343.      41.8       8.19 6.35e-11\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   What does each row in the model output represent?\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n-   Interpret the intercept and the slopes.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n-   Write the model.\n\n*Add response here.*\n\n# Additive vs. interaction models\n\n-   Run the two code chunks below and create two separate plots.
