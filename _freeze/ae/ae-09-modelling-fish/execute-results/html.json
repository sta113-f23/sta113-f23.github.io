Add appropriate labels to the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Your turn (5 minutes):**\n\n    -   If you were to draw a a straight line to best represent the relationship between the heights and weights of fish, where would it go?\n        Why?\n\n        *Add response here.*\n\n    -   Now, let R draw the line for you.\n        Refer to the documentation at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html>.\n        Specifically, refer to the `method` section.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # add code here\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    -   What types of questions can this plot help answer?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n-   **Your turn (3 minutes):**\n\n    -   We can use this line to make predictions. Predict what you think the weight of a fish would be with a height of 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm. Which prediction is considered extrapolation?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n    -   What is a residual?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n# Model fitting\n\n-   **Demo:** Fit a model to predict fish weights from their heights.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Your turn (3 minutes):** Predict what the weight of a fish would be with a height of 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm using this model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   **Demo:** Calculate predicted weights for all fish in the data and visualize the residuals under this model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Model summary\n\n-   **Demo:** Display the model summary including estimates for the slope and intercept along with measurements of uncertainty around them.

What are values correlation can take?\n\n    *Add response here.*\n\n    -   Are you good at guessing correlation?

Plot two separate straight lines for the Bream and Roach species.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Fitting other models\n\n-   **Demo:** We can fit more models than just a straight line.
