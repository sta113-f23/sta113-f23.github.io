And what is one question you have from the reading?\n:::\n\n## Announcements\n\n-   HW 1 is posted, due next Tuesday at 1 pm\n\n# Meet the toolkit: Version control and collaboration with Git and GitHub\n\n## Git and GitHub {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/git-logo.png){fig-alt=\"Git logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"200\"}\n\nGit is a version control system, like \"Track Changes\" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/github-logo.png){fig-alt=\"GitHub logo\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"200\"}\n\nGitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet, like DropBox but much better.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Connecting your Posit Cloud and GitHub accounts\n\nYou should only need to do the following once:\n\n-   Go to [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/spaces/406325/) and log in.\n\n-   Click on your profile avatar (top right) and then click on \"Authentication\".\n\n-   Under Login Options, check the box for \"Enabled\". This will open another window where you should click on \"Authorize rstudio\".\n\n-   Then, go back to the Posit Cloud authentication page, and check the box for \"Private repo access also enabled\".\n\n## Application exercise: Flint {.smaller}\n\n::: task\n\n{{< fa user >}} \n\n\n\n-   Go to the course GitHub Organization and locate your own `ae-03-flint` repository. This repository will be called `ae-03-flint-YOUR_GITHUB_NAME`.\n\n-   Click on the green **Code** button, make sure HTTPS is selected, and copy the URL (by clicking on {{< fa copy size=l >}}).\n\n-   Go to Posit Cloud. Make sure you're in the course space -- it should say STA 113 - F23 on the top left.\n\n-   Click on the blue **New Project** button, and then **New Project from Git Repository**. Paste the URL you copied from your GitHub repository here. Make sure *Add packages from the base project* is checked.\n\n*continue on next slide*\n:::\n\n## Application exercise: Flint {.smaller}\n\n::: task\n-   Once you're in the project, go to the Console and run\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    usethis::create_github_token()\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n-   On the page that pops open in your browser, create a new GitHub Personal Access Token (i.e., sort of like a password you store):\n\n    -   Describe the token's use case under *Note*, e.g., `ae-03`\n\n    -   Extend expiration date to 90 days\n\n    -   Scroll down and click on **Generate Token**\n\n-   Copy the token by clicking on {{< fa copy >}}.\n\n-   Go back to Posit Cloud, to your Console, and run\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    gitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    and paste the token you just copied.\n\nüéâ You're now ready to work on your application exercise analyzing a dataset with **R**, in **RStudio** that you access via **Posit Cloud**, version controlled with **Git**, and hosted on **GitHub**. And that's your data science toolkit! üõ†Ô∏è\n:::\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Next time\n\n-   We'll continue to learn about visualizing various types of data and get practice with the data science workflow.\n\n-   We'll review questions you might have on the homework assignment.\n",
